DROP KEYSPACE

Immediate, irreversible removal of the keyspace, including objects such as tables, functions, and data in the keyspace.

**Note:** DataStax recommends not manually deleting the DSEFS keyspace or other system keyspaces.

**Tip:** A snapshot is automatically created, before the keyspace is dropped; see Restoring from a snapshot for recovery details.

LIST USERS (Deprecated)

Lists internally authenticated users, created users with the command CREATE USER, and have not yet changed the default user.

**Note:**`LIST USERS` is supported for backwards compatibility. Authentication and authorization for DataStax Enterprise 5.0 and later are based on `ROLES`, and `LIST ROLES` should be used.
